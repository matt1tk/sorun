# Sorun.me
Desktop Linux for Creators

Desktop Linux has improved a lot in the last few years, but with a mind-boggling number of distros how does one decide which distro or desktop environment is right for them? How long is it going to take you to customize it to your liking so that you can just focus on your work and not fiddling with the OS instead of the projects you care about?

This is why Sorun.me exists - it is designed for one purpose, aligning the numerous distros and DEs out there to have a more consistent look and feel that doesn't get in the way of the workflows of developers and creators. Sorun.me also does it fast, everything is broken down into modular scripts and can be reused. Additionally if you don't like the default customizations of Sorun.me you can fork this project and create your own yaml config files. You can also create pull requests for changes you'd like to see become part of Sorun.me.
